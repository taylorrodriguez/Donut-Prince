# Donut-Prince
This website is modeled after a donut shop near my home known as "Donut Prince" in Burbank CA. A customer can add any donut or beverage from the menu into to their bag, update the amounts, and delete items. Everything works dynamically including price changes. A google maps api is integrated as well. I used HTML, CSS, and  vanilla JS.
