# Donut-Prince
## About
This website is modeled after a donut shop near my home called "Donut Prince" in Burbank, CA. A customer can add any donut or beverage from the menu into to their bag, update the amounts, and delete items from the cart. Everything works dynamically including price changes. A google maps API is integrated as well. I used HTML, CSS, and  vanilla JS.
